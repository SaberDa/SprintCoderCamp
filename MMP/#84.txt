Given n non-negative integers representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, find the area of largest rectangle in the histogram.

 


Above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1, given height = [2,1,5,6,2,3].

 


The largest rectangle is shown in the shaded area, which has area = 10 unit.

 

Example:

Input: [2,1,5,6,2,3]
Output: 10

class Solution:
    def largestRectangleArea(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
        if not heights:
            return 0
        n = len(heights)
        left = [-1]*n
        right = [n]*n
        for i in range(1, n):
            tmp = i - 1
            while tmp >= 0 and heights[tmp] >= heights[i]:
                tmp = left[tmp]
            left[i] = tmp
        for i in range(n-2,-1,-1):
            tmp = i + 1
            while tmp <= n-1 and heights[tmp] >= heights[i]:
                tmp = right[tmp]
            right[i] =tmp
        res = []
        for i in range(n):
            res.append((right[i] - left[i] -1) *heights[i])
        return max(res)
